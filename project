Project :
        Detecting Pneumonia in Chest X-Rays


Project Description:

          Physicians often use chest X-rays to quickly and cheaply diagnose disease associated with the area.
However, it is much more difficult to make clinical diagnoses with chest X-rays than with other imaging modalities
such as CT or MRI. With computer-aided diagnosis, physicians can make chest X-ray diagnoses more quickly and accurately.
Pneumonia is often diagnosed with chest X-Rays and kills around 50,000 people each year. 
With computeraided diagnosis of pneumonia specifically, physicians can more accurately and efficiently diagnose the disease.
In this project, we hope to train a model using the dataset described below to help physicians in making diagnoses
of pneumonia in chest X-Rays.Our problem is thus a binary classification where the inputs are chest X-ray images 
and the output is one of two classes: pneumonia or non-pneumonia.
