Project :
        Detecting Pneumonia in Chest X-Rays


Project Description:

          Physicians often use chest X-rays to quickly and cheaply diagnose disease associated with the area.
However, it is much more difficult to make clinical diagnoses with chest X-rays than with other imaging modalities
such as CT or MRI. With computer-aided diagnosis, physicians can make chest X-ray diagnoses more quickly and accurately.
Pneumonia is often diagnosed with chest X-Rays and kills around 50,000 people each year. 
With computeraided diagnosis of pneumonia specifically, physicians can more accurately and efficiently diagnose the disease.
In this project, we hope to train a model using the dataset described below to help physicians in making diagnoses
of pneumonia in chest X-Rays.Our problem is thus a binary classification where the inputs are chest X-ray images 
and the output is one of two classes: pneumonia or non-pneumonia.

Dataset Description :
We use a data set compiled by the NIH which contains112,120 chest X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients. 
The data set is available from Kaggle. There are 15 classes (14 diseases, and one for "No findings"). 
Images can be classified as "No findings" or one or more disease classes:
    • Atelectasis 
    • Consolidation 
    • Infiltration 
    • Pneumothorax 
    • Edema 
    • Emphysema 
    • Fibrosis 
    • Effusion 
    • Pneumonia 
    • Pleural_thickening 
    • Cardiomegaly 
    • Nodule Mass 
    • Hernia 
but in this project we are only concerned with detecting pneumonia using the data set that is compiled by NIH.
